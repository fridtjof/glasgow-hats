Okay, per the picture:

you can work out most things.

The four rows of 0.100" header pins are intended to go female, male,
male, female, to minimize the opportunity for shorts with the female
header that the board uses to plug into the glasgow.

Speaking of which, if you used a header with very long pins for that,
you could plug the breakout cable that comes with the 1BitSquared
Glasgow into those pins, and use it, too.

The 8-pin connector is intended for looped test points, so that you
can clip oscilloscope probes on to the lines. The exposed planes along
the edges are for your probe's ground clip.

On the right there's space for screw terminals. Ground is
available twice, just in case there are two grounds in the cable
(or whatever) that you're working with, and you'd like to secure
both of them.

Finally, the little holes are for optional strain relief. You can run
your wires through them before tightening them down in the screw
terminals. Should reduce the likelihood that they'll pop out at an
awkward moment.
