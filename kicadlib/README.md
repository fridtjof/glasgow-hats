# kicad library for glasgow hats

i was tired of double checking that my connector was flipping around
correctly.

everything is laid out so that the connectors should be soldered in
on the side that the 3D view things they're on. for the single port
that'll default to being on top of the board. for the double port
that'll default to being on the bottom of the board. (obviously flipping
the footprint will reverse that.) in large part that was so that
the single port could use the default connector footprint.

the outline present in User.Drawings for the dual port footprint
corresponds to the aluminum case from 1bitsquared.

feel free to open issues or PRs for suggestions/improvements.
