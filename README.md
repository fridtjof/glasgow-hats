# some HATs for the glasgow

okay there's just one so far but i've got another one i just haven't
put together yet. it's pretty simple, too.

## super breakout screw terminal hat

the name could use some work. brings the pins multiple ways, ending
in screw terminals with some holes through the PCB for optional
strain relief.

this was created when i was working on interfacing with something
through a cable i'd cut in half. i needed to bring the individual
wires into screw terminals, ideally keeping them from pulling out.
i also had to put a logic analyzer and a scope on some of the lines
to figure out what was going on. this would've been really handy.
